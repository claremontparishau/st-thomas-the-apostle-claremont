St Vincent de Paul – Notes for St Thomas website

The parish has had an active Conference of the St Vincent de Paul Society since 2005, carrying out the Society’s mission of helping the poor and marginalised in our community.
It does this by members being rostered on duty for one evening a week to respond to calls for assistance which go through a central call centre. Our area of responsibility runs from Mt Claremont/Claremont through to Mosman Park.

The assistance provided is most often a food hamper which we provide from a pantry in the presbytery. We can also assist by paying a proportion of a utility bill for example so the supply is not cut off, paying vehicle registration if use of the vehicle is essential for work, or providing furniture. We collect bread and pastries from two bakeries and do a weekly run to about 30 clients

All this costs money so we are very grateful for donations of food or Coles/Woolworths vouchers to enable our clients to buy fresh food or personal items.

We meet fortnightly to review our assistance and plan our extra activities such as our annual quiz night fundraiser, distribution of Christmas hampers, and the BBQs we provide for our clients at Christmas and Easter.

We are always looking  for new members so if you are interested please contact our President Henry Simmons on 0417985992 or our Treasurer Leo McManus on 0417414951
